    <h1>Kenneth J. Lewis Sr.</h1>
    <hr />

    <p>
      Kenneth J. Lewis Sr. is a self-taught contemporary visual artist, born and raised in Trenton, New Jersey. Remarkably, he did not paint at all until the age of 47—creating his first work after experiencing a sudden, overwhelming urge to express himself through art. Since that pivotal moment, he has developed a powerful and personal visual language that blends abstraction, symbolism, geometry, and landscape.
    </p>

    <p>
      His works often begin with layered and expressive backgrounds. From this abstract foundation, he constructs environments and structures—typically using painter’s tape to shape forms, pathways, and geometric compositions. Kenneth's pieces feature vibrant acrylics, hand-drawn details, spray paint, pastels, and oil glazes. His process allows for both spontaneous expression and structured design, reflecting the balance between chaos and order in life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kenneth's artistic practice is rooted in passion, energy, and intuition. He lives a creative and stress-free life, often painting for hours at a time in his gallery/studio, the KJL Art Sanctuary in Ewing, NJ. This space serves not only as his personal studio but also as a gallery and community hub for exhibitions, paint parties, and workshops. It accommodates up to 20 people and is available by appointment.
    </p>

    <p>
      His work has been exhibited in public and private spaces throughout New Jersey and beyond—including Capital Health Gallery in Hopewell, the Hamilton Township Library (where his works have rotated every six months for over six years), Trenton Public Library, Starbucks Trenton, Ewing Municipal Building, Trenton Social, and numerous group exhibitions. He has upcoming solo shows and large-scale projects scheduled through 2025.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to painting, Kenneth is the creator and host of the <strong>KJL Podcast Channel</strong>, which includes shows like <em>Art with Kenneth</em>, <em>Art History</em>, and <em>The Muse Unveiled Show Experience</em>. These segments explore his creative process, highlight untold stories of Southern Black artists, and document the journey of his muses—everyday people turned into inspired portraits.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kenneth J. Lewis Sr. is driven not by academic theories or traditional rules, but by the emotional and spiritual force behind creation. His mantra, “One moment. One muse. One masterpiece,” captures the essence of his work: deeply human, rooted in experience, and boldly expressive.
