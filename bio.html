  <h1>About the Artist</h1>
  <div class="bio-content">
    <p>Kenneth J. Lewis Sr. is a prolific, self-taught visual artist whose wide-ranging body of work defies categorization. With a fearless approach to medium and style, his paintings span the boundaries of figurative storytelling, abstract expressionism, and geometric minimalism—often blending them all into a single, commanding visual experience.</p>

    <p>Working from his KJL Art Sanctuary in Ewing, NJ, Kenneth paints on canvas, panel, wood, paper, and even unconventional surfaces like architectural samples. Each series—whether exploring cultural identity, emotional depth, or purely formal composition—is part of a larger conversation about human experience, resilience, and imagination. His versatility has allowed him to create over 600 works in the last 15 years, gaining recognition from collectors, curators, and art enthusiasts nationwide.</p>

    <p>What makes Kenneth’s practice unique is not just his productivity, but his fearless experimentation. He incorporates painter’s tape, oil glazes, gel mediums, soft pastel, and collage in ways that reflect a layered and intuitive process. There are no rules—only rhythm, gesture, and instinct.</p>

    <p>His work has been shown in galleries, libraries, and public institutions, and he regularly engages with the public through studio visits, art talks, and the popular <strong>KJL Podcast Channel</strong>, where he shares both his creative process and the stories behind the art.</p>

    <p>If you’re a curator, collector, gallery owner, or simply someone who loves art that speaks with authenticity and spirit—Kenneth J. Lewis Sr. offers not just paintings, but entire worlds.</p>
