  <p>
    The Clock Series explores time not as a neutral measure, but as a governing force.
    Each painting encodes a pivotal historical first using the clock face to represent
    the month and day of the event, with the year embedded within the composition.
    Figures, structures, and machines emerge through loose, expressive brushwork and
    layered surfaces, allowing history and emotion to coexist.
  </p>
  <p>
    These works examine how innovation transformed time into authority, shaping
    movement, labor, and modern life.

  <div class="art-card">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjlartsanctuary/kjlartsanctuary.github.io/main/First%20Airplane.jpg" alt="Airplane Clock Series Painting">
    <h2>Airplane</h2>
    <div class="meta">Oil on canvas · 24 x 36 inches · December 17, 1903</div>
    <p>
      Referencing the Wright brothers’ first successful powered flight, this painting uses
      cool tones, fractured space, and loosely suggested figures to convey uncertainty,
      ambition, and experimentation. The aircraft appears as an impression rather than a
      fixed image, emphasizing risk and possibility. The clock anchors the moment while
      the surrounding surface remains open and gestural.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="art-card">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjlartsanctuary/kjlartsanctuary.github.io/main/First%203%20Signal%20Traffic%20Light.jpg" alt="Traffic Light Clock Series Painting">
    <h2>Traffic Light</h2>
    <div class="meta">Oil on canvas · 24 x 36 inches · November 20, 1923</div>
    <p>
      This work references Garrett Augustus Morgan’s three-position traffic signal.
      Built through layered color and assertive mark-making, the street system reads as
      a symbol of pause, permission, and control. The clock dominates as an authority,
      while the surrounding space stays loose and expressive.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="art-card">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjlartsanctuary/kjlartsanctuary.github.io/main/First%20Bike.jpg" alt="Bicycle Clock Series Painting">
    <h2>Bicycle</h2>
    <div class="meta">Oil on luan board · 28 x 37 inches · April 12, 1817</div>
    <p>
      Referencing Karl von Drais’ first documented ride of the Draisine, this piece reduces
      the bicycle and rider into essential forms built through heavy texture and restrained
      tone. The raw surface and loose brushwork echo early experimentation, where balance
      and movement were inseparable from time.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjlartsanctuary/kjlartsanctuary.github.io/main/First%20Locomotive%20Steam%20Engine.jpg" alt="Steam Locomotive Clock Series Painting">
    <h2>Steam Locomotive</h2>
    <div class="meta">Oil on canvas · 24 x 36 inches · February 21, 1804</div>
    <p>
      This painting marks Richard Trevithick’s first successful run of a steam locomotive
      on rails. The train emerges through thick, gestural paint and loosely defined forms,
      evoking heat, weight, and motion. The clock reads as a quiet authority inside the
      composition, signaling mechanized time.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="art-card">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjlartsanctuary/kjlartsanctuary.github.io/main/Standard%20Work%20Week.jpg" alt="Standard Work Week Clock Series Painting">
    <h2>Standard Work Week</h2>
    <div class="meta">Acrylic on canvas · 24 x 36 inches · June 19, 1868</div>
    <p>
      Referencing the establishment of the eight-hour workday for federal employees,
      this work centers the human body inside regulated time. Elongated figures and
      symbolic forms are rendered through simplified lines and layered color fields.
      The clock becomes a governing presence rather than a neutral object.
